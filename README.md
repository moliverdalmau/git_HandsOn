# git_HandsOn

The code is a Python script that classifies a sequence as either DNA or RNA, and optionally searches for a user-defined motif within the sequence. 
The script takes two arguments: a sequence (-s or --seq) and an optional motif (-m or --motif). 
The input sequence is first converted to uppercase letters, then checked to ensure it contains only 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', or 'U' characters. 
If the sequence contains 'T', it is classified as DNA, if it contains 'U', it is classified as RNA, otherwise it is classified as "not DNA nor RNA". 
If the motif argument is provided, the script searches for the motif within the sequence and reports if it was found or not.

"seqClass is a command-line tool to classify a sequence as DNA or RNA."
"The script takes two arguments: the sequence and an optional motif to search for."
"The input sequence is converted to uppercase letters and checked to ensure it contains only valid DNA/RNA characters."
"The sequence is classified as DNA if it contains 'T', RNA if it contains 'U', and 'not DNA nor RNA' otherwise."
"If a motif is provided, the script will search for it within the sequence and report if it was found or not."
